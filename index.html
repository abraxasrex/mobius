        Human Centered Design (HCD) is a recursive ideational approach set to address the intricacies of human emotion, aesthetics, process and goal completion, user stories and approaches, and expectation/violation management in a streamlined experience.

        Our domains we interact with contain many facets and limitations that we must navigate to progress with successful innovation. These challenges that surround this navigation are best discussed with HCD considerations.  All solutions to complex problems are multifaceted, from the difficult to create, minimally refined, novel, "simple" solutions to the multi-system, cross-compatible "complex" solution.  A solution that excels enables compatibility between to two or more different components, while seamlessly bridging a gap between distant attributes.  This is evident in hook-and-loop fasteners, commonly referred to as Velcro.  The properties of hook-and-loop connections allow integration between different domain objects.  While the physical connection provided by the fastener allows the objects to interact in proximity, the abstract connection of different domains adds a fascinating element to its list of characteristics and capabilities.

        HCD excels when it enables parts to resonate together and allows personal expression, while engineering approaches design with specifications, rigid boundaries, and corner case consideration.  An engineer can often be assessed on the presence or absence of a metric or feature, such as an engine with more HP, with less dB noise, or remote controlled throttle.  An HCDer is often appraised on the ability to address a situation or workflow.   Drawing further from the engine idea, HCD is validated upon the user interacting with the engine: context (assembly, operation, and maintenance), language (manuals, warning placement, legibility, and comprehension), appeal (aesthetics, ergonomics, or ease of use), and function choices (lawn-mower, car, and/or generator).
      </p>
      <p>
        Technology advancements have enabled the shortening of specific steps within the design processes for individuals and teams practicing HCD theories, such as rapid prototyping and deployment, cloud based services, personal scheduling and information management, the shrinking global community, and frameworks and hardware that enable live feedback and predictive analysis.  These tools and paradigms enable researchers and designers to be more responsive to address the fluctuating requirements of varying users.  The future of successful HCD resides in the ability to fulfill requirements with minimal compromise.
